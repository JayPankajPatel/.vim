## Install 
clone and forget about setup,
make sure you back up your exists .vimrc and/or vim files
clone to `~`, open vim and simply run `:PlugInstall`

## Configs
Mappings and configurations can be found under `custom` please tweak them to your liking.

## Issues
Using this setup in a windows with WSL is slow however using it with 
regular windows and other linux distros works fine, I've only tested it in Arch.
